# Packet-Sniffing-and-Spoofing
**Description:**   This project explores packet sniffing and spoofing to understand network vulnerabilities and security measures. It involves using tools like Scapy to capture and manipulate network packets and writing custom programs to simulate attacks. The work is conducted in a controlled Docker-based environment for hands-on learning.
